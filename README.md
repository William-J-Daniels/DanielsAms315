# About

This is a quick and simple repo to share the code I wrote for AMS 315: Data Analysis at Stony Brook univerisity.
The class had two computing projects, each with their own subdirectory in this repo.
I also had some fun writing code that runs on my HP Prime calculator.

## Computing Project 1

I did this project with python and the libraries Numpy, Padas, Matplotlib, Scipy, and Scikit-learn.
To see my work and generate the reports, run the notebooks `project_1_part_a.ipynb` and `project_1_part_b.ipynb` then run pdflatex on the `.tex` files.
I also added notebooks and code in which I test my code against textbook examples and experiment with running the code on many data sets.
The project description PDF is also provided.

## Computing Project 2

I did this project with R.
To see my work and generate the report, run the `.r` file and the `.tex` file.
The project description PDF is also provided.

## HP Prime Python

A significant part of the course focused on analysis of variance tables.
Because making them by hand is repetitive and somewhat error prone, I wrote micropython code than runs on my HP Prime calculator to make checking my work for such problems easier.
